# RecycleLevels

This was originally a Hackathon project, but my group didn't finish so I decided to work on it outside of the hackathon because i liked the idea. I've never used Android Studio before and barely used Java so this project was a daunting but very educational experience. We have designed an alpha version of an android app that utilizes a neural network we trained using the Google Cloud services.
The app  allows the user to snap a photo of any piece of trash that is picked up and it is then classified into one of the 6 categories that the network was trained on. Based on the category, a point value and information about the category is displayed to the user. In future implementations we want to implement directions to the nearest recycling center.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Download the latest APK from the release section of this repo
2. Open the app and take a picture of your trash
3. Identify the trash
4. Hopefully the AI trained identified the garbage, and you can learn more about your recycling your trash.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Machine Learning Usage

This wasn't my first time working with Tensorflow or the Google Cloud, I also used both in my [Nutriscan Repo](https://github.com/KaaiiH/NutriScan). But it was my first time working with a neural network and dataset. 

_For more examples, please refer to the [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/video-lecture)_ 
Or refer to the [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/getting-started-keras) I followed


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Finished Fronted for Menu
- [x] Improve neural network by training it with a dataset
- [ ] Fix fatal bugs in app.
