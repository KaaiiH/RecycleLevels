# RecycleLevels

We have designed an alpha version of an android app that utilizes a neural network we trained using the Google Cloud services.
The app  allows the user to snap a photo of any piece of trash that is picked up and it is then classified into one of the 6 categories that the network was trained on. Based on the category, a point value and information about the category is displayed to the user. In future implementations we want to implement directions to the nearest recycling center.
